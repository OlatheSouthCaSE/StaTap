#StaTap

##Introduction

Hello! Thanks for coming to check out our application!

This application was created as a senior project by 6/10 of Olathe South High School's C.A.S.E. program's 2015 Seniors.

Since our application was built with only one use in mind, we ran into a few issues with letting others be able to use it. Specifically, the application is tough to test/emulate without use of a 10.1" tablet at 2560x1600. These are all things that would have been fixed and been accounted for if we had time.

Thus, this application stands to serve mainly as a learning experience for us as Seniors, by taking our skills we learned throughout High School and attempting an ambitious project.

Our program took the idea of recording basketball stats using an application. This would eliminate the need for a pen-and-paper score/playbook to record real-time game stats. This program can be compared to the likes of Hudl, but at the time, there was none like it. Hudl is mainly for tagging game footage afterward aswell, while ours is used for ingame functionality and also post-game.
